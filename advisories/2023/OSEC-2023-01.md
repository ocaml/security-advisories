# Time of check time of use issue in opam's cache

## Bug description

Opam uses since version 2.0.0 a download cache: if a source artifact is needed, first its hash is looked up in the local cache (~/.opam/download-cache/<hash-algorihm>/<hash>). Opam supports multiple hash algorithms, a cache lookup tries all hash algorithms present in the opam file. Before opam 2.1.5, the hash of a cache entry as encoded in its file name was trusted and not checked against its content.

If a package specifies only a single (non-weak) hash algorithm, this lead to the source artifact taken as is, any error while writing the artifact into the cache, or reading it from the cache, was not detected. Also, in certain setups, if the download cache is shared (writable) across containers (for example in some CI systems), this leads to the possibility of cache poisoning.

Thanks to Raja and Kate, the issue was fixed in [PR 5538](https://github.com/ocaml/opam/pull/5538)
